Personal identification numbers are widely used for user authentication and security. Password
authentication using PINs requires users to physically input the PIN, which could be vulnerable
to password cracking via shoulder surfing or thermal tracking. PIN authentication with hands-off
eye blinks PIN entry techniques, on the other hand, leaves no physical footprints behind and
therefore offers a more secure password entry option. eye blinks based authentication refers to
finding the eye blinks across sequential image frames, and generating the PIN. This project
presents a real-time application we combine eye blink-based PIN entry, and face detection and
OTP (One Time Password) to avoid shoulder surfing and thermal tracking attacks.
